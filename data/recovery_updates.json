The debt collection continues.\r\n\r\nJune 3 2021: Since the last update, \u20ac104 913 has been recovered from Aforti. The debt collection continues.\r\n\r\nMay 6 2021: Following the legal enforcement proceedings of the courts in Poland, a bailiff was assigned for the case we had put forward against Aforti. The bailiff has initiated the process of investigation and seizure of various Aforti company's assets in order to facilitate the debt collection and the transfer of the collected funds to investors on Mintos, the primary creditors of Aforti. Mintos has been informed by the bailiff that several bank accounts of Aforti have been seized while the process is yet to be finalized. At the moment of the suspension, there were \u20ac2.2 million in investors' investments at risk and until today, an additional ~\u20ac0.1 million in interest has been amortized. Since the last update, \u20ac476 069 has been recovered from Aforti. The debt collection continues.\r\n\r\nApril 1 2021: Mintos is awaiting a bailiff being assigned to the case. We continue to expect the legal enforcement actions to be launched in the first half of 2021.\r\n\r\nMarch 5 2021: Mintos is awaiting a bailiff being assigned to the case. We continue to expect the legal enforcement actions to be launched in the first half of 2021.\r\n\r\nFebruary 4 2021: Mintos is still awaiting a bailiff being assigned to the case. We expect the enforcement actions to be launched in the first half of 2021. Hopefully, the situation with Covid-19 in Poland will not get worse and the courts will be able to function faster than currently.\r\n\r\nJanuary 7 2021: Mintos is still awaiting a bailiff being assigned to the case. We remain aware that the COVID-19 pandemic and respective remote work conditions have caused delays in the work of the Courts in Poland. Since the last update, the company has repaid \u20ac 10 219, including principal and interest.\r\n\r\nNovember 27 2020: Mintos is still awaiting a bailiff being assigned to the case. We remain aware that the COVID-19 pandemic and respective remote work conditions have caused delays in the work of the Courts in Poland.\r\n\r\nOctober 30 2020: In August 2019, Mintos suspended the Primary and Secondary Market for loans originated by Aforti Finance due to the company\u2019s overdue transfers of borrower\u2019s repayments to investors on Mintos and agreed to a payment schedule with Aforti. Mintos did not receive payments as agreed. After lengthy negotiations, in February 2020, Mintos and Aforti Finance agreed on a restructured payment schedule and additional security for investors. Given the agreed payment schedule was not met, in spring 2020 Mintos started legal action against Aforti Finance and Aforti Holding. As we informed in the last update, we are in the process of commencing enforcement proceedings and awaiting a bailiff being assigned to the case. We remain aware that the pandemic and respective remote work conditions have caused delays in the work of the Courts in Poland. Since the last update, Aforti has repaid \u20ac 23 906, including principal and interest.",

The interest on pending payments will accrue and will be payable after the principal and accrued interest on the principal is paid down in full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>October 30 2020: On 16 April 2020, Akulaku was suspended from the Primary and Secondary Markets due to late payment settlement. Since the last update, the situation remains unchanged. The lending company is making payments according to the agreed-upon schedule each week. Up to date, Akulaku has repaid more than &euro; 6.5 million and we&#39;re currently in the final stages of agreeing on a new repayment schedule in the interest of investors on Mintos.

Please learn more<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pC378BKPLc&amp;t=2785s\"> in our recent AMA session</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>October 7 2021: Since the last update, no funds were repaid to investors in AlexCredit UA loans. The debt collection company servicing the portfolio continues to transfer the collected amounts. The situation with debt collection processes in Ukraine remains complicated, which restricts us from recovering more than we do at the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>September 3 2021: Since the last update, the recovered amount is &euro;6 515. The debt collection company servicing the taken-over portfolio continues to transfer the collected amounts. The situation with debt collection processes in Ukraine remains complicated, as previously reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>August 5 2021: Mintos and the debt collection agency servicing the former AlexCredit portfolio have worked to solve the pending obstacles for the collected funds&rsquo; transfer to investors on Mintos and expects to receive the first payments in the coming weeks, after which they will immediately be disbursed among investors. However, we see that the debt collection volumes in Ukraine have decreased due to borrowers ability to repay, as well as the introduced regulation on debt collection servicers activities, such as the number of times to contact the borrowers and others. We are evaluating the current situation and might require adjustment of the expected recovery volumes. We will update investors with more specific details and projections after we receive the full information requested. More updates will be shared in the next quarterly funds in the recovery session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>July 1 2021: The debt collection company servicing the loan portfolio taken over from AlexCredit continues to collect borrowers&rsquo; repayments. The previously reported delay for the funds&rsquo; transaction from Ukraine to Mintos persists, and Mintos, together with the debt collection company, is working to solve it as fast as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>June 3 2021: The debt collection company servicing the loan portfolio taken over from AlexCredit continues to collect borrowers&rsquo; repayments. The previously reported delay for the funds&rsquo; transaction from Ukraine to Mintos persists, and Mintos, together with the debt collection company, is working to solve it as fast as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May 6 2021: The debt collection company servicing the loan portfolio taken over from AlexCredit continues to collect borrowers&rsquo; repayments. There is a delay in transferring these funds to Mintos and investors due to a need for additional paperwork required for financial transactions in Ukraine - it is soon to be solved. We thank investors for their patience as we work to solve this as soon as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>April 1 2021: The debt collection company servicing the loan portfolio taken over from AlexCredit has further collected additional amounts, for now totalling &euro; 35 000. These funds will be transferred to investors after the first quarter of 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>March 5 2021: The plan for the debt collection company servicing the loan portfolio taken over from AlexCredit for the first quarter of 2021 was to recover &euro; 45 000. The company thus far has recovered &euro; 30 000. These funds will be transferred to investors after the first quarter of 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>February 4 2021: The collection agency, hired by Mintos, has taken over part of the AlexCredit loan portfolio as agreed and initiated collections. The company has already started making repayments to investors on Mintos. The repayments begin with relatively small amounts and are forecasted to increase over time. For 2021, we forecast to recover around &euro; 400 000 - &euro; 500 000 from AlexCredit. For clarity purposes, we report on the part of the AlexCredit portfolio taken over and being serviced, and not the overall company portfolio which AlexCredit continues to service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>January 7 2021: The collection agency, hired by Mintos, has taken over part of the AlexCredit loan portfolio as agreed, and initiated collections. We will be updating investors later in January on the condition of the portfolio once the agency has evaluated its full state, along with expectations for funds to be recovered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>November 27 2020: Mintos is in process to take over some part of the lending companies loan portfolio, still being in final stages of signing the respective agreements and finalizing the legal procedure before the collection agency can start working with AlexCredit loans. October 30 2020: At the end of March 2020, AlexCredit&rsquo;s loans were suspended from the Primary and Secondary Markets on Mintos due to missed settlement payments to investors on Mintos. As we mentioned before, Mintos agreed with AlexCredit&#39;s management that Mintos will take over some part of its loan portfolio, bringing in a third party collection agency. The portfolio has been pledged to Mintos and is now in the final stages of being transferred to the respective collection agency. The legal side of this process considers significant work across two jurisdictions with three legal parties involved, taking its share of time. The source of the recovery of investors&#39; funds will come from the proceeds of the collections. After we start the collections process, we will be able to share more clarity of expected recovery volumes and time needed to recover it.</p>",

The expected recovery for Q1 2021 is EUR 64 200 and PLN 160 700. Currently, we are also in the process of opening an escrow account in one of the Polish banks. This account will be used to automatically channel funds from Capital Service to investors on Mintos, without the possibility of Capital Service withholding the funds. It will be a very similar structure that Capital Service had with their bondholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>January 7 2021: The previously mentioned agreement is in place with no edits or changes to it. Capital Service is expected to start covering the accumulated pending payments to investors in February 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>November 27 2020: Mintos and Capital Service have agreed on a repayment plan for Capital Service to cover the accumulated pending payments to investors that arose from failing to transfer borrowers repayments and buyback price in full on time. The agreement was concluded outside of the legal proceedings and is not part of the simplified restructuring procedure known as Covid Shield programme in Poland, hence allowing for a more speedy process of recovering investor funds. The Capital Service repayment plan consists of regular monthly payments which will increase over time. Initial payment amounts are EUR 64 200 and PLN 160 700. The repayment plan includes a repayment of 100% of the outstanding funds without any reduction. In addition to the repayment plan, Mintos and Capital Service have agreed to a mandatory use of lending company&rsquo;s excess cash flows, or so called &ldquo;cash sweep&rdquo;. This means that if the financial standing of Capital Service improves, the size of repayment will additionally increase to what is set in the repayment plan. The amount of repayment increase is a function of Capital Service financial performance. This mechanism is defined in the agreement signed. The first payment according to the repayment plan will be made at the end of February 2021. The repayment plan stipulates regular payments over three years, followed by a so-called bullet payment to cover the remaining amount. According to the agreed repayment plan, the remaining balance in three years will be EUR 14.8 million and PLN 161 thousand. Mintos does not exclude a possibility of an additional restructuring at the end of the three year plan period, or sooner, if the situation requires so. The agreed repayment plan accounts for a pragmatic view on the Capital Service&rsquo;s ability to make repayments to investors on Mintos. The company&rsquo;s loan portfolio consists of EUR 16.7 million in current loans (less than 90 days past due), which is 68.3% of total portfolio, and EUR 7.8 million in late loans (31.7% of total portfolio).The lending company&rsquo;s revenue for the last six months period ending 30 October 2020 was EUR 6.4 million, down 50.7% year-over-year (YOY). Net loss stood at EUR 3.5 million for the last six months, and the net portfolio was EUR 19.7 million (down 25.7%) as of 30 October 2020. The agreement between Mintos and Capital Service contains a covenant package, which will allow Mintos to closely monitor the lending company and control its costs. Mintos expects Capital Service to remain committed to the agreed repayment schedule. Click <a href=\"http://https://www.mintos.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-27-at-20.29.50.png\">here</a> to see the repayment plan to cover the outstanding funds to investors on Mintos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The agreed repayment plan comes after initial proposal from Capital Service which included a 40% reduction of the existing amount of funds due to investors and a repayment over 8 years, with the first 2 years being a grace period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>October 30 2020: On 6 April 2020, Capital Service was suspended from the Mintos Primary and Secondary Markets due to a failure to make timely settlement payments to investors on Mintos. Mintos is in the process to find common ground with Capital Service on repayment conditions. As we mentioned in the last update, Capital Service had entered the COVID19 Shield programme in Poland that will end in mid-November 2020. As part of the programme, there is a creditors meeting for CapitalService SA set for 6 November during which creditors will vote on each of it&rsquo;s repayment proposal received from Capital Service. Mintos is part of the proceedings. In the meantime, we continue the negotiation with Capital Service with an aim to reach an agreement with Capital Service outside of the legal proceedings. Mintos and Capital Service are aiming to conclude the new repayment agreement in approximately by mid-November - bilaterally with Capital Service.</p>",

Mintos, as a representative of investors on Mintos, is the main creditor. Along with the lending company being insolvent, it plans to sell its loan portfolio during the liquidation process to cover the commitments towards its creditors. The liquidation process may take up to 6 months. Cashwagon Philippines (Green Money Tree Lending Corp) is about to submit for a bankruptcy process, during which the company plans to sell off its loan portfolio.

Cashwagon Vietnam continues to await criminal proceedings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>February 4 2021: Due to a failed attempt to raise additional funds last autumn, Cashwagon is now in the liquidation process. Mintos is Cashwagon&#39;s key creditor and we are closely involved in that liquidation process. The recoveries will not come from Cashwagon transferring borrowers&rsquo; repayments, but instead from proceeds of the liquidation of the company. Because these proceeds are of relatively low value, the expected recovery of investors&#39; funds currently stands at 20-40%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>January 7 2021: Cashwagon is preparing for a voluntary wind-down of the holding company in Singapore and its subsidiaries across South East Asia. We are in constant communication with Cashwagon&#39;s management and working to achieve the best possible outcome for investors in the current circumstances. We will be updating investors as soon as the lending company confirms its next steps with all its creditors, Mintos and investors on Mintos being one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>November 27 2020: The company is still operating at a minimum capacity and is unable to settle the outstanding debt. Talks with potential investors have been depleted. As we mentioned last time, Cashwagon is preparing for liquidation of the company in Singapore and its subsidiaries across South East Asia. We are in constant communication with Cashwagon&#39;s management and working to develop the best possible outcome for investors in the current circumstances, including a potential out of court settlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>October 30 2020: On June 8 and June 10 2020, CashWagon Vietnam and CashWagon Philippines and Indonesia were suspended from the Primary and Secondary Markets due to news that the authorities in Vietnam are investigating operations of Cashwagon and in the meantime have frozen the company&rsquo;s accounts, as per the procedure of the investigation situation in Vietnam. The company is currently operating at a minimum capacity and is unable to settle the outstanding debt. Talks with potential investors have been depleted. Cashwagon is preparing for liquidation of the company in Singapore and its subsidiaries across South East Asia. We will share more on what it means for investors as soon as the company finalizes its decision for liquidation.</p>",

The audit firm was appointed for liquidating the parent company, Cashwagon Singapore, which owned investments in other entities, including entities that had funding with Mintos. The company also provided the group guarantee as additional means of security. During the 2-year period, the firm managed to recover only small amounts from other investments, for example, 90k SGD (or around &euro;60k EUR). These small amounts don&rsquo;t even cover the liquidators fees of 500k SGD (or around &euro;350k EUR). Most of the investments, i.e., lending companies, have ceased their operations. Hence, there is nothing to reclaim from the group guarantee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In regard to the two entities where Mintos investors have exposure:<br />\r\nVietnam &mdash; the liquidator has been trying to sell the Vietnamese entity and due diligences were undergone by several potential buyers, but none of the buyers were ready to make the deal. This could have potentially brought back the operations of the entity. Meanwhile, the investigation by the police is still ongoing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philippines &mdash; similar to Vietnam, there was a potential buyer identified who was willing to buy the license of the entity.

Indonesia&#39;s entity is still in the liquidation process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historical updates:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>December 2 2021: The situation with Cashwagon currently remains the same as in the last update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>November 4 2021: The situation has not changed since the last update and Cashwagon is still in the liquidation process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>October 7 2021: Cashwagon Singapore and Peerman Indonesia are still in the process of liquidation. Cashwagon Philippines (Green Money Tree Lending Corp) has not filed for bankruptcy yet.

Cashwagon Vietnam continues to await criminal proceedings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>July 1 2021: Cashwagon Singapore and Peerman Indonesia continue to be in the liquidation process. Cashwagon Philippines (Green Money Tree Lending Corp) hasn&rsquo;t yet but will soon submit for a bankruptcy process, during which the company plans to sell off its loan portfolio.

Cashwagon Vietnam continues to await criminal proceedings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>April 1 2021: Cashwagon Singapore and Peerman Indonesia are in the liquidation process, which may take up to 6 months. Cashwagon Philippines (Green Money Tree Lending Corp) will soon submit for a bankruptcy process, during which the company plans to sell off its loan portfolio. The bankruptcy process may take about 12 months. Cashwagon Vietnam continues to await criminal proceedings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>March 5 2021: Cashwagon Singapore and Peerman Indonesia has submitted for a liquidation process and has been assigned with a liquidator - Nexia TS, a pan-Asia firm with over two decades of experience in the local market. Mintos, as a representative of investors on Mintos, is the main creditor. Along with the lending company being insolvent, it plans to sell its loan portfolio during the liquidation process to cover the commitments towards its creditors. The liquidation process may take up to 6 months. Cashwagon Philippines (Green Money Tree Lending Corp) is about to submit for a bankruptcy process, during which the company plans to sell off its loan portfolio. The bankruptcy process may take about 12 months. Mintos awaits Cashwagon Phillippines&rsquo;s submission evaluation to be able to proceed with the next steps. Cashwagon Vietnam continues to await criminal proceedings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>February 4 2021: Due to a failed attempt to raise additional funds last autumn, Cashwagon is now in the liquidation process. Mintos is Cashwagon&#39;s key creditor and we are closely involved in that liquidation process. The recoveries will not come from Cashwagon transferring borrowers&rsquo; repayments, but instead from proceeds of the liquidation of the company. Because these proceeds are of relatively low value, the expected recovery of investors&#39; funds currently stands at 20-40%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>January 7 2021: Cashwagon is preparing for a voluntary wind-down of the holding company in Singapore and its subsidiaries across South East Asia. We are in constant communication with Cashwagon&#39;s management and working to achieve the best possible outcome for investors in the current circumstances. We will be updating investors as soon as the lending company confirms its next steps with all its creditors, Mintos and investors on Mintos being one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>November 27 2020: The company is still operating at a minimum capacity and is unable to settle the outstanding debt. Talks with potential investors have been depleted. As we mentioned last time, Cashwagon is preparing for liquidation of the company in Singapore and its subsidiaries across South East Asia. We are in constant communication with Cashwagon&#39;s management and working to develop the best possible outcome for investors in the current circumstances, including a potential out of court settlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>October 30 2020: On June 8 and June 10 2020, CashWagon Vietnam and CashWagon Philippines and Indonesia were suspended from the Primary and Secondary Markets due to news that the authorities in Vietnam are investigating operations of Cashwagon and in the meantime have frozen the company&rsquo;s accounts, as per the procedure of the investigation situation in Vietnam. The company is currently operating at a minimum capacity and is unable to settle the outstanding debt. Talks with potential investors have been depleted. Cashwagon is preparing for liquidation of the company in Singapore and its subsidiaries across South East Asia. We will share more on what it means for investors as soon as the company finalizes its decision for liquidation.</p>",

The audit firm was appointed for liquidating the parent company, Cashwagon Singapore, which owned investments in other entities, including entities that had funding with Mintos. The company also provided the group guarantee as additional means of security. During the 2-year period, the firm managed to recover only small amounts from other investments, for example, 90k SGD (or around &euro;60k EUR). These small amounts don&rsquo;t even cover the liquidators fees of 500k SGD (or around &euro;350k EUR). Most of the investments, i.e., lending companies, have ceased their operations. Hence, there is nothing to reclaim from the group guarantee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In regard to the two entities where Mintos investors have exposure:<br />\r\nVietnam &mdash; the liquidator has been trying to sell the Vietnamese entity and due diligences were undergone by several potential buyers, but none of the buyers were ready to make the deal. This could have potentially brought back the operations of the entity. Meanwhile, the investigation by the police is still ongoing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philippines &mdash; similar to Vietnam, there was a potential buyer identified who was willing to buy the license of the entity.

Mintos is Cashwagon&#39;s key creditor and we are closely involved in that liquidation process. The recoveries will not come from Cashwagon transferring borrowers&rsquo; repayments, but instead from proceeds of the liquidation of the company. Because these proceeds are of relatively low value, the expected recovery of investors&#39; funds currently stands at 20-40%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>January 7 2021: Cashwagon is preparing for a voluntary wind-down of the holding company in Singapore and its subsidiaries across South East Asia.

The company is currently operating at a minimum capacity and is unable to settle the outstanding debt. Talks with potential investors have been depleted. Cashwagon is preparing for liquidation of the company in Singapore and its subsidiaries across South East Asia. We will share more on what it means for investors as soon as the company finalizes its decision for liquidation.</p>",

Due to the challenging environment on the financial markets, Creditstar was only able to raise &euro;14 million in new capital out of the planned &euro;30 million, from which the company had to repay the bonds that matured in December. The company had also planned to fully cover the restructured pending payments by raising capital. As a result, Creditstar won&rsquo;t be able to cover the restructured pending payments of &euro;8.3 million by 31 December 2022 as originally agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To remedy the situation, Creditstar is required to cover repayments on the restructured amounts from its operational cashflows, and will also continue working on attracting additional financing to pay down the restructured pending payments faster. The company is in the process of onboarding a financial investor to raise &euro;10-15 million in debt investment, which it expects to complete by the end of February 2023. It has also applied for an increase in its credit line facility with a Swedish financial group, which it expects to receive by the end of Q1 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering all of the above, we&rsquo;ve agreed to prolong the restructuring process, while making sure investors are compensated adequately for rolling over their investments. Creditstar is required to cover all pending payments by the end of May 2023. The company has to make regular biweekly transfers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To compensate investors for rolling over their investments, Creditstar has paid a one-time &ldquo;sweetener&rdquo; of 1% of the rolled-over amounts. The money was distributed to investors on 6 January 2023. To make sure investors are receiving adequate interest for the period, pending payments interest for the restructured amount will remain at 18% per annum, which is significantly above the current average market rate of 13.6%. The company must also fully cover any new pending payments within the standard settlement period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We received the regular settlement of &euro;345k from Creditstar this week.&nbsp;</p>",

Due to the challenging environment on the financial markets, Creditstar was only able to raise &euro;14 million in new capital out of the planned &euro;30 million, from which the company had to repay the bonds that matured in December. The company had also planned to fully cover the restructured pending payments by raising capital. As a result, Creditstar won&rsquo;t be able to cover the restructured pending payments of &euro;8.3 million by 31 December 2022 as originally agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To remedy the situation, Creditstar is required to cover repayments on the restructured amounts from its operational cashflows, and will also continue working on attracting additional financing to pay down the restructured pending payments faster. The company is in the process of onboarding a financial investor to raise &euro;10-15 million in debt investment, which it expects to complete by the end of February 2023. It has also applied for an increase in its credit line facility with a Swedish financial group, which it expects to receive by the end of Q1 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering all of the above, we&rsquo;ve agreed to prolong the restructuring process, while making sure investors are compensated adequately for rolling over their investments. Creditstar is required to cover all pending payments by the end of May 2023. The company has to make regular biweekly transfers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To compensate investors for rolling over their investments, Creditstar has paid a one-time &ldquo;sweetener&rdquo; of 1% of the rolled-over amounts. The money was distributed to investors on 6 January 2023. To make sure investors are receiving adequate interest for the period, pending payments interest for the restructured amount will remain at 18% per annum, which is significantly above the current average market rate of 13.6%. The company must also fully cover any new pending payments within the standard settlement period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We received the regular settlement of &euro;345k from Creditstar this week.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>",

In light of this permission, Revo has already transferred the first tranche of its repayment in the amount of &euro;2.6m, and Mintos has received these funds on its accounts. In order to ensure the most fair treatment of Mintos investors in the given situation, the usual amortization sequence has been amended, and repaid funds were distributed proportionally to all affected investors based on their outstanding investments in Revo portfolios. Fees due to Mintos from Revo have also been collected proportionally, instead of collecting all fees upfront.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please note that the estimated recovery ranges don&rsquo;t account for potential sanctions against Russia or Russian retaliation measures that might be introduced due to recent developments, as the details are currently unknown.</p>",

Finko UA repayments consist of two streams - the first is from the Finko UA operational income from borrowers&rsquo; repayments and debt collection, and the second is from the previously reported claim rights for additional funds in the amount of &euro;8.37 million (to be paid on a monthly basis for two years with a bullet payment at the end). The operational income of Finko UA forms the largest part of the repayments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>September 3 2021: Since the last update, Finko UA has repaid &euro;43 000. We remind that Finko UA repayments consist of two streams - one, Finko UA operational income from borrowers&rsquo; repayments and debt collection, and second, from the previously reported claim rights for additional funds in the amount of &euro;8.37 million (to be paid on a monthly basis for two years with a bullet payment at the end). The operational income of Finko UA forms the largest part of the repayments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>August 5 2021: Since the last update, Finko UA has repaid &euro;330 512, according to the repayments schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>July 1 2021: Finko UA transferred &euro;43 000 today that will appear in the next update. The scheduled June payment of &euro;300 000 was delayed and will be transferred soon. Mintos and Finko UA, following the evaluation of possible increase of repayments to investors, have identified and established claim rights for additional funds of Finko UA. As a result, Mintos has reached an agreement for a repayment of &euro;8.37 million for Finko Ukraine liabilities. This will lead to a recovery of a lion&#39;s share of the current remaining exposure (87%) of the remaining exposure in Ukraine (as of 1 July 2021, total amounts in recovery constitute &euro;9.57 million). The remaining part of the exposure is planned to be covered with funds from the debt collection activities in Ukraine with the Finko UA borrowers&rsquo; repayments. The agreement sets a repayment schedule for two years with monthly payments and a bullet payment at the end of the maturity. After the first two years, the repayment options will be reviewed once again. Current agreement allows extending the repayment schedule for another two years, should the company not be fit to make a bullet payment after the first two year period. First payments have already reached investors on Mintos. Assessing the current situation, we believe that Finko UA&rsquo;s recovery will be either in full or close to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>June 3 2021: Since the last update, Finko UA has made a transfer to Mintos in the amount of &euro;1 147 889.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May 6 2021: Finko UA has covered the previously delayed monthly repayment and since the last update has made a transfer of &euro;790 114. A further repayment in the amount of &euro;327 000 was made at the beginning of May - it is not reflected in the table above since it reports on a monthly basis, yet we mention it as the amount due from the previous month. Mintos continues to negotiate the previously mentioned additional security for investors from other affiliated entities of the lending company. From the moment of suspension from the Mintos marketplace in August 2020, the monthly running costs have decreased by &euro;191 000 when compared to March 2021 for Dinero and Ukrpozyka combined. Breakdown on monthly reduction: Indirect operating expenses reduced by &euro;79 000, salaries and related taxes reduced by &euro;67 000, marketing expenses reduced by &euro;24 000, direct operating expenses reduced by &euro;21 000. Indirect operating expenses: The main reason for the reduction in Indirect operating expenses is a decrease in received Management service invoices. The Group is not billing Management fee (OPEX) invoices to Dinero or Ukrpozyka (Group continues to charge IT CAPEX invoices). Also, there has been a significant decrease in IT costs. IT costs have been held to a minimum level only to support servers and the most significant IT infrastructure. Salaries and related taxes: The main reason for the reduction in salary costs is the decrease in the number of employees. Overall, in both companies salary costs have been reduced by &euro;67 000 (48%) on a monthly basis. If we exclude one-off expenses then monthly salary costs have decreased by &euro;87 000 (63%) compared to August 2020. Both companies reduced the number of their employees by 60 (53%), in the reported period. The current biggest departments are Debt Collection and Customer Service. Marketing expenses: In March 2021, there were no Marketing expenses. Direct operating expenses: In March 2021, for both companies, there was a decrease in almost all Direct operating expenses positions compared to August 2020. In March, the companies had only bank commission expenses and Debt collection expenses for outsourced debt collectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>April 1 2021: Finko UA was not able to make the monthly repayment to investors on Mintos due to pending documentation update confirmation with the lending company&rsquo;s bank in Ukraine. The update takes longer than expected. In the coming 2 weeks, it is planned to make a transfer in the amount of &euro;1,2 million. The lending company apologizes for the delay, and further repayments will be made with prior regularity. Mintos continues to negotiate additional security for investors from other affiliated entities of the lending company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>March 5 2021: Finko UA was not able to make the monthly repayment to investors on Mintos because of a need to update the existing documentation with the bank in Ukraine. The lending company apologizes for the delay, and the repayments will continue in a couple of weeks. We continue to negotiate additional security for investors from other affiliated entities of the lending company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>February 4 2021: Finko UA continues to service existing loans and transfer borrowers&rsquo; repayments accordingly. Since the last update, we have recovered &euro; 409 765, including principal and interest. The situation in Ukraine remains difficult due to the impact of Coivd-19. We are currently negotiating additional security for investors from other affiliated entities of the lending company. This security should eventually ensure the possibility of full recovery of investors&#39; funds. That&#39;s still a work in progress and we&#39;ll inform investors once the deal is finalized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>January 7 2021: Finko UA continues to service existing loans and transfer borrowers&rsquo; repayments accordingly. Since the last update, we have recovered &euro; 650 367, including principal and interest. Ukraine continues to experience COVID-19 pandemic difficulties, having an impact on borrowers repayment discipline. While the number of COVID-19 cases has decreased compared to its peak numbers in 2020, it remains a relatively high number of new cases daily. <a href=\"https://moz.gov.ua/article/news/urjad-prodovzhiv-karantin-do-28-ljutogo-2021-roku-z-posilennjam-obmezhen-z-8-do-24-sichnja\">The government of Ukraine has extended the quarantine until February 28, 2021.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>November 27 2020: Finko UA continues to service existing loans and transfer borrowers&rsquo; repayments accordingly. Since the last update, we have recovered &euro; 1 196 178, including principal and interest. Investors must note that similar to Europe, Ukraine is also experiencing a surge of COVID19 cases - restrictions might be imposed again, having an impact on borrowers repayment discipline. The quarantine in Ukraine has been extended to 31 December 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>October 30 2020: On 21 August 2020, loans issued by lending companies Dinero and UkrPozyka, both part of the Finko group and portrayed as Finko UA on Mintos, were suspended from the Primary and Secondary Markets after they had decided to initiate a wind-down of their businesses due to the current economic situation in Ukraine. Details on loan portfolios at that time can be found in an <a href=\"https://www.mintos.com/blog/finko-ua-dinero-and-ukrpozyka-enters-a-voluntary-wind-down/)\">update on our blog </a>. The management teams of both lending companies have expressed that outstanding investment will be covered in full by the end of July 2021. Finko UA continues to service existing loans and transfer borrowers&rsquo; repayments accordingly. Since the last update, we have recovered &euro; 587 000, including principal and interest. Investors must note that similar to Europe, Ukraine is also experiencing a surge of COVID19 cases - restrictions might be imposed again, having an impact on borrowers repayment discipline.</p>",

First, though the change of legal form does not change the legal person who is responsible for the debts, it is unclear why this change was made.

Needless to say, we were not informed about this decision or intention, and we learned this from public sources. We have discussed with our lawyers and are proceeding with steps in regard to this matter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, just days before the registration for the relevant legal procedures, Dziesietka prematurely repaid selected bonds, of which they informed everyone on their web-page.

The initial restructuring agreement was negotiated and active, with the lending company respecting it by making monthly repayments to investors on Mintos. Currently, a new restructuring agreement has not been reached with Dziesiatka, and Mintos will pursue litigation to recover investors&rsquo; funds. July 1 2021: Since the last update, Dziesiatka Finanse has not made any repayments. The lending company has not resumed its commitments towards investors as previously agreed. The character of this cooperation has changed along with the lending company&rsquo;s management and its advisory company&rsquo;s SSW Pragmatic Solutions continued neglect to provide the necessary information and come to an agreement for the remaining funds repayments.

The advisor of the lending company, SSW Solutions, had advised that payments will be resumed in March this year, however, with no indication over more precise time or repayment volume. So far, the management team of Dziasiatka and its advisory company SSW Solutions have not been available for contact, nor have provided the requested information.

We have been advised that payments will be resumed in March this year, however, with no indication over more precise time or repayment volume. Also, despite our requests, we have not been provided any financial data justifying the resuming of repayments in March as feasible.

                        "description": "<p>December 2 2021: As Mintos recently informed the affected investors in email, the E-Cash case has been finalized with the company making its final repayment of &euro;410 864. Together with the repayment, Mintos received a list of loans that were repaid by the borrowers, hence Mintos was able to allocate borrower repayments to the investors who held parts of the repaid loans. In total, Mintos recovered 35% of the initial exposure at the time of E-Cash&rsquo;s suspension. The unrecovered funds from E-Cash are now in bad debt status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>November 4 2021: An update on E-cash is coming soon to the affected investors in email. We will share the update also on this page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>September 3 2021: As of August 2021, Mintos had recovered 35% of the funds in recovery from E-Cash, with the remaining to be considered as a loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>August 5 2021: In April 2021, lending company E-Cash informed Mintos of its plans to wind down its business operations. Due to E-Cash having missed regular settlement payments to investors for 7 days and a wind-down process that hadn&rsquo;t yet been evaluated, Mintos suspended the lending company from the Primary and Secondary Markets on 21 April 2021. At the time of the suspension, there were 11 516 investors with active investments in loans issued by E-Cash, with the average investment per investor being &euro; 62.03. Having an overall &euro; 1 117 096 outstanding investments due to investors at the time of suspension, Mintos initiated the process of the recovery of investors funds. To maximize recovered amounts for investors, Mintos evaluated multiple recovery options. Following a thorough evaluation of the company&#39;s accounts, agreements and respective recovery prospects, we decided in favour of an out-of-court settlement with E-Cash as the best option, taking into account the very short duration of E-Cash issued loans, servicing costs of the portfolio, and the time required of different recovery options. With these considerations in mind, Mintos acted in the best interest of the investors to recover as much as possible, as fast as possible. After an extensive negotiation process, the initially expected recovery rate, as first shared with investors on 11 May 2021 during the quarterly review on funds in recovery, was less than 25%, with the company being in stage 4 (read more about the stages and details of the recovery processes). This recovery rate was increased to 35%. E-Cash estimates that the repayments and debt collection process with its borrowers are completed, which means the lending company can finalize its wind-down and transfer the negotiated amount of &euro; 410 864.26 to investors on Mintos. Mintos has received these funds and will be distributing them as soon as possible next week, after receiving the necessary confirmation of the lending company&rsquo;s borrowers&rsquo; repayments data, needed to confirm the distribution of repayments among investors on Mintos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>July 14 2021: We&rsquo;re changing the status to defaulted as current estimated cash flows are not sufficient to cover the full exposure. Along with continuing negotiations, we&rsquo;re defaulting the lending company in order to speed up the process of recovery of funds for investors on Mintos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>July 1 2021: The negotiations continue with an aim for immediate partial debt repayments in previously expected recovery volumes, or more. Mintos and E-Cash are in the process of agreeing on a legal framework for the resolution of the debt on behalf of the lending company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>June 3 2021: Mintos continues the negotiation process with the lending company to solve the current situation. May 6 2021: The lending company was suspended from the Primary and Secondary Markets on Mintos on 21 April 2021, until the company&rsquo;s initiated wind-down process is more clear and the current commitments towards investors on Mintos will be settled. At the time of suspension, the investors&rsquo; invested funds at risk totaled &euro;407 255. Mintos is in a negotiation process with the lending company to solve the current situation.</p>",

The rest will be repaid with the help of other ExpressCredit group entities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>April 1 2021: JCS ExpressCredit Holding&rsquo;s unfulfilled obligations towards Mintos investors are in large part due to a delay in disbursements of the source of repayment to ExpressCredit. We have been working with JSC ExpressCredit Holding and have reached an agreement on a regular monthly repayment plan of the outstanding debt towards investors on Mintos until July 2024.

We will update investors as soon as the negotiations with each company are finalized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>January 7 2021: Since the last update, JSC ExpressCredit Holding has transferred a total amount of &euro; 137 663, including principal and interest which has been fully released to investors. JCS ExpressCredit Holding&rsquo;s unfulfilled obligations towards Mintos investors are in large part due to a delay in disbursements of the source of repayment to ExpressCredit. The delayed payment amount from the source of repayment would be sufficient to cover most of the outstanding debt. Going forward, we have agreed upon the same monthly repayments in Q1 2021 while negotiating a further repayment schedule for the rest of the year which is largely dependent on delayed payments from source of repayment to ExpressCredit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>November 27 2020: Since the last update, JSC ExpressCredit Holding has transferred a total amount of &euro; 165 149, including principal and interest.

We will continue to negotiate the best possible recovery schedule in the interest of investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>October 30 2020: On 30 April 2020, loans listed through JSC ExpressCredit Holding were suspended from the Mintos Primary and Secondary Markets, due to the company failing to transfer borrower repayments and the buyback price in full and on time. We are expecting partial payment in the next couple of days. Going forward, we are expecting regular monthly payments. We will continue the negotiations and will inform investors of the results in upcoming updates.</p>",

In principal an agreement has already been reached, and we are working on formalizing necessary transactional documents. Many Fenchurch loans are taking longer than expected to settle as national lockdowns, covid restrictions, and other imposed government regulations in the UK have had a significant impact on the legal cases that Fenchurch has been funding for the past 24 months. Before Covid-19, court cases took on average 9-12 months, while they now take 12-18 months (and some take even longer). As a result, some investors might see that some loans are taking longer to be repaid.\r\n\r\nFenchurch is currently pursuing refinancing options. If the refinancing is successful, Fenchurch would be able to buy back outstanding investments, and investors might receive their money earlier.\r\n\r\nTo ensure investors are receiving adequate compensation for investments that will be paid back later than initially scheduled, interest on any delayed repayments will be increased to 1.4x the base interest rate (investors will receive 13% on average).",

We believe this approach is fair and in the interests of investors for repayments to be linked to repayments made by borrowers since in this particular case we are receiving precise information from the lending company on the status of each loan. In essence, loans that will be repaid by Vark&#39;s borrowers will be amortized on Mintos, after receiving funds from Varks.

Collections efforts significantly decreased in October due to the ongoing <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/armenia/\">Covid-19 impact</a>&nbsp;and the effects of the state of the war in the country (which recently ended with a cease-fire agreement on 10 November). According to the information provided by Varks, gross portfolio decreased by 25% or &euro; 10.5 million from 01.04.2020 to 31.10.2020. This amount was used to cover &euro; 2.4 million in operational expenses for the period, and &euro; 9.3 million were transferred to Mintos investors. Please note: the table in the link below reports on the period from 1 April 2020 to 31 October 2020 which is a period slightly after the suspension of Varks on Mintos. <a href=\"https://www.mintos.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/varks-repayment-112020.png\">View the table</a>&nbsp;.Varks transferred an additional &euro; 1.34 million between its suspension on 25 March and 1 April (the beginning of the period of the aging statistics shared above). A total of &euro; 10 582 614 was transferred to Mintos investors in the period from 25 March to 30 October. Varks reports that it is too early to assess the possible impact of the recently ended state of war in Armenia on the repayment schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>October 30 2020: On 24 March 2020, the Board of the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia (CBA) published a revocation of license for the lending company United Credit Joint Stock Company, which operates under the brand name Varks. Varks, as a part of the Finko group, is represented as Finko AM on the Mintos marketplace. The reason for the revocation, according to the announcement by the CBA, was a violation of the minimum capital requirements. Finko AM (Varks), a part of Finko Group, has proposed a commitment to follow a repayment timeline to cover the amount due to investors on Mintos by the end of 2022. Payments in the amount of &euro; 10 582 614 were made in the timeframe between the moment of suspension and 29 October 2020. Since the last update, Varks has repaid &euro;800 000, including principal and interest. Varks management team reports that currently it is difficult to predict the long-term impact of Armenia and Azerbaijan conflict on borrowers&rsquo; repayment discipline. At this point, the company sees that the borrowers repayments amounts in October 2020 - &euro; 0.35 million (as of 28 October) - have decreased for more than 3 times in comparison to average monthly repayments amounts prior to the time of conflict back in June - &euro; 1.89 million, July - &euro; 1.84 million and August - &euro; 1.79 million. We remind that the conflict between the two countries took military action in September 2020. Borrowers&rsquo; repayment amounts in September were &euro; 1.29 million. Further delay in repayments is expected, considering that the majority of men in Armenia are summoned to join army forces while interrupting attendance of work. Varks remains operational and committed to do the utmost to deliver on the payments to the investors, even in the difficult times of the conflict. Mintos will report on the situation once more is known.</p>",

The operational income of Finko UA forms the largest part of the repayments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>August 5 2021: Since the last update, Finko UA has repaid &euro;330 512, according to the repayments schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>July 1 2021: Finko UA transferred &euro;43 000 today that will appear in the next update. The scheduled June payment of &euro;300 000 was delayed and will be transferred soon. Mintos and Finko UA, following the evaluation of possible increase of repayments to investors, have identified and established claim rights for additional funds of Finko UA. As a result, Mintos has reached an agreement for a repayment of &euro;8.37 million for Finko Ukraine liabilities. This will lead to a recovery of a lion&#39;s share of the current remaining exposure (87%) of the remaining exposure in Ukraine (as of 1 July 2021, total amounts in recovery constitute &euro;9.57 million). The remaining part of the exposure is planned to be covered with funds from the debt collection activities in Ukraine with the Finko UA borrowers&rsquo; repayments. The agreement sets a repayment schedule for two years with monthly payments and a bullet payment at the end of the maturity. After the first two years, the repayment options will be reviewed once again. Current agreement allows extending the repayment schedule for another two years, should the company not be fit to make a bullet payment after the first two year period. First payments have already reached investors on Mintos. Assessing the current situation, we believe that Finko UA&rsquo;s recovery will be either in full or close to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>June 3 2021: Since the last update, Finko UA has made a transfer to Mintos in the amount of &euro;1 147 889.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May 6 2021: Finko UA has covered the previously delayed monthly repayment and since the last update has made a transfer of &euro;790 114. A further repayment in the amount of &euro;327 000 was made at the beginning of May - it is not reflected in the table above since it reports on a monthly basis, yet we mention it as the amount due from the previous month. Mintos continues to negotiate the previously mentioned additional security for investors from other affiliated entities of the lending company. From the moment of suspension from the Mintos marketplace in August 2020, the monthly running costs have decreased by &euro;191 000 when compared to March 2021 for Dinero and Ukrpozyka combined. Breakdown on monthly reduction: Indirect operating expenses reduced by &euro;79 000, salaries and related taxes reduced by &euro;67 000, marketing expenses reduced by &euro;24 000, direct operating expenses reduced by &euro;21 000. Indirect operating expenses: The main reason for the reduction in Indirect operating expenses is a decrease in received Management service invoices. The Group is not billing Management fee (OPEX) invoices to Dinero or Ukrpozyka (Group continues to charge IT CAPEX invoices). Also, there has been a significant decrease in IT costs. IT costs have been held to a minimum level only to support servers and the most significant IT infrastructure. Salaries and related taxes: The main reason for the reduction in salary costs is the decrease in the number of employees. Overall, in both companies salary costs have been reduced by &euro;67 000 (48%) on a monthly basis. If we exclude one-off expenses then monthly salary costs have decreased by &euro;87 000 (63%) compared to August 2020. Both companies reduced the number of their employees by 60 (53%), in the reported period. The current biggest departments are Debt Collection and Customer Service. Marketing expenses: In March 2021, there were no Marketing expenses. Direct operating expenses: In March 2021, for both companies, there was a decrease in almost all Direct operating expenses positions compared to August 2020. In March, the companies had only bank commission expenses and Debt collection expenses for outsourced debt collectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>April 1 2021: Finko UA was not able to make the monthly repayment to investors on Mintos due to pending documentation update confirmation with the lending company&rsquo;s bank in Ukraine. The update takes longer than expected. In the coming 2 weeks, it is planned to make a transfer in the amount of &euro;1,2 million. The lending company apologizes for the delay, and further repayments will be made with prior regularity. Mintos continues to negotiate additional security for investors from other affiliated entities of the lending company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>March 5 2021: Finko UA was not able to make the monthly repayment to investors on Mintos because of a need to update the existing documentation with the bank in Ukraine. The lending company apologizes for the delay, and the repayments will continue in a couple of weeks. We continue to negotiate additional security for investors from other affiliated entities of the lending company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>February 4 2021: Finko UA continues to service existing loans and transfer borrowers&rsquo; repayments accordingly. Since the last update, we have recovered &euro; 409 765, including principal and interest. The situation in Ukraine remains difficult due to the impact of Coivd-19. We are currently negotiating additional security for investors from other affiliated entities of the lending company. This security should eventually ensure the possibility of full recovery of investors&#39; funds. That&#39;s still a work in progress and we&#39;ll inform investors once the deal is finalized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>January 7 2021: Finko UA continues to service existing loans and transfer borrowers&rsquo; repayments accordingly. Since the last update, we have recovered &euro; 650 367, including principal and interest. Ukraine continues to experience COVID-19 pandemic difficulties, having an impact on borrowers repayment discipline. While the number of COVID-19 cases has decreased compared to its peak numbers in 2020, it remains a relatively high number of new cases daily. <a href=\"https://moz.gov.ua/article/news/urjad-prodovzhiv-karantin-do-28-ljutogo-2021-roku-z-posilennjam-obmezhen-z-8-do-24-sichnja\">The government of Ukraine has extended the quarantine until February 28, 2021.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>November 27 2020: Finko UA continues to service existing loans and transfer borrowers&rsquo; repayments accordingly. Since the last update, we have recovered &euro; 1 196 178, including principal and interest. Investors must note that similar to Europe, Ukraine is also experiencing a surge of COVID19 cases - restrictions might be imposed again, having an impact on borrowers repayment discipline. The quarantine in Ukraine has been extended to 31 December 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>October 30 2020: On 21 August 2020, loans issued by lending companies Dinero and UkrPozyka, both part of the Finko group and portrayed as Finko UA on Mintos, were suspended from the Primary and Secondary Markets after they had decided to initiate a wind-down of their businesses due to the current economic situation in Ukraine. Details on loan portfolios at that time can be found in an <a href=\"https://www.mintos.com/blog/finko-ua-dinero-and-ukrpozyka-enters-a-voluntary-wind-down/)\">update on our blog </a>. The management teams of both lending companies have expressed that outstanding investment will be covered in full by the end of July 2021. Finko UA continues to service existing loans and transfer borrowers&rsquo; repayments accordingly. Since the last update, we have recovered &euro; 587 000, including principal and interest. Investors must note that similar to Europe, Ukraine is also experiencing a surge of COVID19 cases - restrictions might be imposed again, having an impact on borrowers repayment discipline.</p>",

The claim in the court process is that GetBucks Botswana (legal name FirstCred) cannot cover its liabilities to creditors and, therefore, should be winded down by an appointed liquidator. By doing this, the assets would be sold, and the money would be divided among the creditors. We have made the claim together with another creditor. This approach was chosen because, for a long time, the management of GetBucks Botswana has not been genuine in looking for resolution while using investors&#39; money for other purposes. Since the beginning of the court process in early June, several legal procedures have taken place, including a court hearing on 2 August. The initial court opinion is expected to be heard on 30 August 2022. Mintos has also paid a security deposit of &euro;30k to the court, which was required for the court process to continue.

Mintos remains in close communication for further progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>November 4 2021: Since the last update, GetBucks has not made a new repayment. Mintos is in the ongoing process of negotiating a restructuring agreement along with the repayments schedule to re-establish the payments from the lending company. The company is struggling with attracting additional funding with growing concerns in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>October 7 2021: Since the last update, GetBucks has not made a new repayment. Mintos is in the process of negotiating a restructuring agreement along with the repayments schedule to re-establish the payments from the lending company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>September 3 2021: Since the last update, GetBucks has not made a new repayment. Mintos is in the process of finalizing a restructuring agreement along with the repayments schedule to re-establish the payments from the lending company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>August 5 2021: Since the last update, GetBucks has repaid &euro; 228 986, according to the newly formalized repayments schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>July 1 2021: Mintos and GetBucks have agreed on a monthly restructuring package, namely a repayment in the amount of BWP 2.5million (&euro;190 000) for the next two years, with a bullet payment or a possibility for a reviewed restructuring at the end of it. Currently the legal details are being finalized before the agreement is implemented fully. Since the last update, GetBucks has repaid &euro;141 416.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>June 3 2021: Mintos has given GetBucks a restructuring proposal and is now waiting for their feedback. Since the last update, GetBucks has repaid &euro;148 430.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May 6 2021: Mintos and GetBucks Botswana continue to negotiate a feasible monthly repayment schedule. In the meantime, since the last update, Getbucks has made a repayment of &euro;173 610.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>April 1 2021: While Mintos and GetBucks Botswana continue to negotiate a feasible monthly repayment schedule. In the meantime, since the last update, Getbucks has made a repayment of &euro; 181 811. After a video call with the company&#39;s ultimate beneficial owner, it was agreed to work towards the restructuring of GetBucks Botswana debts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>March 5 2021: While Mintos and GetBucks Botswana continue to negotiate a feasible monthly repayment schedule, Getbucks verbally committed circa &euro;193 000 monthly repayments, however, only one repayment has been received so far. A video call with the company&#39;s ultimate beneficial owner is scheduled for this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>February 4 2021: After the internal restructuring of GetBucks Botswana, the lending company and Mintos are working on a repayment schedule to continue payment transfers to investors on Mintos in the upcoming months. At this point Mintos is evaluating the financial data of GetBucks Botswana. As you can see in the updated table above, the amount portrayed as repaid by the company is a difference of currency fluctuations among statements and does not reflect any factual repayment. GetBucks has made a payment &euro; 193 000 on 29 January which has been transferred to Mintos in February, hence not part of the reporting period in the table above and will be reported next month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>January 7 2021: GetBucks Botswana didn&#39;t make a payment in December due to an internal process of restructuring the company&#39;s cash flow to continue payment transfers to investors on Mintos in 2021. The company remains committed to the agreements to cover obligations to investors on Mintos and plans to resume the monthly repayments this month, January 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>November 27 2020: GetBucks Botswana continues to make monthly payments. Since the last update, GetBucks Botswana has repaid &euro; 300 005, including principal and interest. October 30 2020: On 30 April 2020, GetBucks Botswana and Zambia were suspended from the Primary and Secondary Markets due to failing to fulfil their payment obligations in full to Mintos investors. GetBucks Botswana continues to make monthly payments. Since the last update, GetBucks Botswana has repaid &euro; 272 091, including principal and interest.</p>",

Hence, the situation with GetBucks ZM currently remains the same as in the last update, and Mintos continues negotiating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>October 7 2021: The restructuring agreement for GetBucks BW that is still being negotiated includes the repayment of commitments to investors with investments in GetBucks ZM-issued loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>September 3 2021: The restructuring agreement for GetBucks BW assumes repayment of commitments due to investors with investments in GetBucks ZM-issued loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>August 5 2021: The restructuring agreement for GetBucks BW assumes repayment of commitments due to investors with investments in GetBucks ZM-issued loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>July 1 2021: The restructuring agreement currently in development for GetBucks BW assumes a repayment of commitments due to investors with investments in GetBucks ZM-issued loans. June 3 2021: Mintos is still in the process of establishing a repayment schedule with GetBucks Zambia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May 6 2021: Mintos is in the process to establish a repayment schedule with GetBucks Zambia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>April 1 2021: Mintos continues to work to access the Zambia lending company&rsquo;s repayment capacity and reach an interim repayment solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>March 5 2021: Previously shared plans about the possible Malawi business deal did not commence, thus the management of the lending company resumes the plans for an IPO to raise funds to cover the existing commitments it has towards investors on Mintos. While Mintos welcomes IPO as well as any other fundraising initiative, in the meantime we work to access the Zambia lending company&rsquo;s repayment capacity and reach an interim repayment solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>February 4 2021: MyBucks SA continues to evaluate possibilities to repay all debts and creditors of MyBucks SA, Mintos and investors on Mintos being among them. We expect new progress updates in the beginning of Q2 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>January 7 2021: MyBucks SA continues to evaluate possibilities to repay all debts and creditors of MyBucks SA, Mintos and investors on Mintos being among them. We expect more updates later in January, as we work to fasten the process with the lending company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>November 27 2020: Since the last update, the situation remains largely the same: MyBucks SA is evaluating an alternative offer to dispose of 100% (instead of the 49% the company reported previously) shareholding in MBC Malawi to a reputable international financial services group. The cash proceeds from the disposal will be used to repay all debts and creditors of MyBucks SA. As we mentioned in the recent call with investors on our recovery efforts and in the previous update, the situation with GetBucks Zambia is also difficult due to a significant currency devaluation in the country. We expect that the most likely route of recovering funds will be through the group guarantee, rather than the operating cash flow of the GetBucks Zambia entity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>October 30 2020: On 30 April 2020, GetBucks Botswana and Zambia were suspended from the Primary and Secondary Markets due to failing to fulfil their payment obligations in full to Mintos investors. MyBucks SA (the guarantor of GetBucks Zambia) announced on 23 June 2020 that it is selling 49% of MBC Malawi to the Mpatsa Group. Since it has not yet received the necessary regulatory approvals, the transaction has not yet been completed. Since the last update, the situation remains the same: MyBucks SA is evaluating several options and engaging with various other potential investors to acquire a portion of the equity of MBC Malawi. In addition, MBC Malawi is planning an IPO in which MyBucks SA will dispose of a portion of its shareholding. As we mentioned in the recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZR1Vjv6W7k&amp;t=283s\">call with investors on our recovery efforts </a>, the situation with GetBucks Zambia is also difficult due to a significant currency devaluation in the country.

ID Finance has made decent progress with attracting new funding and has reached agreements with new investors. However, onboarding the new investors involves a change of ownership requiring approval by the competent regulator, which is taking longer than anticipated. ID Finance expects to finalize the process by March 2023, which means the company won&rsquo;t be able to cover the restructured pending payments of &euro;18 million by 31 December 2022 as originally agreed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering the funding initiatives that ID Finance is pursuing are close to completion and sufficient to cover the outstanding amounts, we&rsquo;re confident that the lending company will be able to honor its obligations. Hence, we&rsquo;ve agreed on extending the repayment schedule, while making sure investors are compensated adequately for rolling over their investments.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nID Finance has to make biweekly transfers from its operational cashflows, as well as larger transfers as soon as the company has finished onboarding the new investors. The company has to fully repay the restructured pending payments for ID Finance Spain by 31 March 2023, and for Mexico by 31 July 2023. The company must also fully cover any new pending payments within the standard settlement period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make sure investors are receiving adequate interest for the period, ID Finance has to continue paying increased interest of 1.4x the base interest rate on the restructured pending payments on an ongoing basis. On average, investors will receive 17.6% interest on the restructured pending payments, which is significantly above the current average market rate of 13.6%.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ID Finance Mexico paid &euro;500k this week, which were distributed to investors.

ID Finance has made decent progress with attracting new funding and has reached agreements with new investors. However, onboarding the new investors involves a change of ownership requiring approval by the competent regulator, which is taking longer than anticipated. ID Finance expects to finalize the process by March 2023, which means the company won&rsquo;t be able to cover the restructured pending payments of &euro;18 million by 31 December 2022 as originally agreed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering the funding initiatives that ID Finance is pursuing are close to completion and sufficient to cover the outstanding amounts, we&rsquo;re confident that the lending company will be able to honor its obligations. Hence, we&rsquo;ve agreed on extending the repayment schedule, while making sure investors are compensated adequately for rolling over their investments.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nID Finance has to make biweekly transfers from its operational cashflows, as well as larger transfers as soon as the company has finished onboarding the new investors. The company has to fully repay the restructured pending payments for ID Finance Spain by 31 March 2023, and for Mexico by 31 July 2023. The company must also fully cover any new pending payments within the standard settlement period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make sure investors are receiving adequate interest for the period, ID Finance has to continue paying increased interest of 1.4x the base interest rate on the restructured pending payments on an ongoing basis. On average, investors will receive 17.6% interest on the restructured pending payments, which is significantly above the current average market rate of 13.6%.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ID Finance Mexico paid &euro;500k this week, which were distributed to investors.

Receiving back the invested funds has proven to be challenging due to the various sanctions and payment limitations imposed by Russia and the European Union. We&rsquo;ve talked about this extensively on our <a href=\"https://www.mintos.com/blog/russia-ukraine-war-impact-update-swift-ban-rub-plunge-pausing-listing-new-loans-from-belarus-and-more/\">blog</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all Russian lending companies we discussed potential options how they could make repayments in a way that was compliant with the limitations we and the Russian lending companies have been facing. Despite the events happening around the war, the reputation of the people involved in the business is in most cases the single most important factor, especially in businesses that require external funding or might be related to operations outside their home country. Until winter 2022 we had seen that all the companies were having the discussion in good faith and with the intent to resolve the situation. As a result, agreements have been reached with all but one Russian lending company, and payments have been made or are being processed by the banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, for one entity, namely Kviku, the situation has turned out differently. Kviku informed us through email at the end of November 2022 that it had unilaterally converted all EUR debt to RUB, combined it with existing RUB debt arising from investments made outside of Forward Flow setup, and further converted it to an interest free bond in RUB with a principal repayment at the end of 2026. For investments made with Forward Flow (about &euro;5 million exposure), Kviku has neither shared any information nor repaid any funds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on our lawyers&rsquo; preliminary analysis, neither the way the funds were converted nor the amounts converted are in line with the existing legislative acts.

A payment of 10 million RUB has already been received from one lending company, Revo. And for the remaining lending companies, we&rsquo;re finalizing additional paperwork so they can pay to our FX account. In the short term, the 10 million RUB payments will be used to settle the funds in recovery from Russia. Although the new FX account is a step in the right direction, we&rsquo;re actively looking into alternative payment routes so we can receive larger payments and recover funds faster in the medium term (next 2-4 months). However, these can take some time to set up. So far, we&#39;ve developed the structure on how payments could be made.

Last week, we had a video conference with our lawyer in Kosovo and the liquidator who is appointed by the central bank of Kosovo. We have received an informal answer that the liquidator expects the tax investigation of Monego to be over by the end of February 2021. It is expected that Monego will repay several million to investors or Mintos and agree on a full repayment schedule once the tax audit is done, according to the written communication by the liquidator.We have agreed on a follow-up call with the liquidator in mid-February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>January 7 2021: Mintos continues to request more information on the status of the case, as well as the funds due to investors on Mintos, from the appointed liquidator and plans to widen the requests to the respective local government institutions. November 27 2020: After the information on the two payments to unregistered creditors in the Monego case, Mintos is awaiting further information from the liquidator on the funds due to investors on Mintos. October 30 2020: In December 2019, the Central Bank of Kosovo (CBK) suspended the license of Monego due to breaches of local regulation on APR caps for local borrowers. As a result, Monego stopped issuing new loans. CBK appointed an administrator for liquidation of the lending company. The latest information shared by the administrator is that it is awaiting the outcome of the tax audit before there will be more clarity on further payments. The tax audit is being done by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and it was supposed to be done in July 2020, however, it was postponed several times. We&#39;ve also received information that several employees of PwC, who were doing the audit, have been tested positive for Covid-19 and that delayed the audit reports significantly. In the meantime, Mintos has obtained information that the administrator has supposedly violated the law by making two payments to unregistered creditors in the Monego case, using funds of Monego issued loans borrowers&rsquo; repayments. Mintos has also received a confirmation from the two creditors of them receiving these payments. We have made inquiries to the administrator, as well as the CBK and are working towards informing the Finance Ministry of Kosovo state. We will inform investors as soon as we have more information.</p>",

The claim in the court process is that GetBucks Botswana (legal name FirstCred) cannot cover its liabilities to creditors and, therefore, should be winded down by an appointed liquidator. By doing this, the assets would be sold, and the money would be divided among the creditors. We have made the claim together with another creditor. This approach was chosen because, for a long time, the management of GetBucks Botswana has not been genuine in looking for resolution while using investors' money for other purposes. Since the beginning of the court process in early June, several legal procedures have taken place, including a court hearing on 2 August. The initial court opinion is expected to be heard on 30 August 2022.

The claim was accepted by the court. Additionally, we sent a notice about the exercise of the repurchase obligations to GetBucks Botswana and GetBucks Zambia. Acceleration of the outstanding obligations will strengthen the position of Mintos in the guarantor&rsquo;s bankruptcy proceeding, and we are now waiting for a resolution from the court, if the accelerated total amount of &euro;9.5 million (for entities in Botswana and Zambia) will be added to the registered claim.</p>",

The key points in the agenda are -how to deal with the existing liabilities; the business model going further; the fundraising progress update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historical updates:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>December 2 2021: As the company is struggling, we have not managed to reach a restructuring solution yet. Mintos remains in close communication for further progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>November 4 2021: Since the last update, GetBucks has not made a new repayment. Mintos is in the ongoing process of negotiating a restructuring agreement along with the repayments schedule to re-establish the payments from the lending company. The company is struggling with attracting additional funding with growing concerns in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>October 7 2021: Since the last update, GetBucks has not made a new repayment. Mintos is in the process of negotiating a restructuring agreement along with the repayments schedule to re-establish the payments from the lending company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>September 3 2021: Since the last update, GetBucks has not made a new repayment. Mintos is in the process of finalizing a restructuring agreement along with the repayments schedule to re-establish the payments from the lending company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>August 5 2021: Since the last update, GetBucks has repaid &euro; 228 986, according to the newly formalized repayments schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>July 1 2021: Mintos and GetBucks have agreed on a monthly restructuring package, namely a repayment in the amount of BWP 2.5million (&euro;190 000) for the next two years, with a bullet payment or a possibility for a reviewed restructuring at the end of it. Currently the legal details are being finalized before the agreement is implemented fully. Since the last update, GetBucks has repaid &euro;141 416.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>June 3 2021: Mintos has given GetBucks a restructuring proposal and is now waiting for their feedback. Since the last update, GetBucks has repaid &euro;148 430.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May 6 2021: Mintos and GetBucks Botswana continue to negotiate a feasible monthly repayment schedule. In the meantime, since the last update, Getbucks has made a repayment of &euro;173 610.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>April 1 2021: While Mintos and GetBucks Botswana continue to negotiate a feasible monthly repayment schedule. In the meantime, since the last update, Getbucks has made a repayment of &euro; 181 811. After a video call with the company&#39;s ultimate beneficial owner, it was agreed to work towards the restructuring of GetBucks Botswana debts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>March 5 2021: While Mintos and GetBucks Botswana continue to negotiate a feasible monthly repayment schedule, Getbucks verbally committed circa &euro;193 000 monthly repayments, however, only one repayment has been received so far. A video call with the company&#39;s ultimate beneficial owner is scheduled for this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>February 4 2021: After the internal restructuring of GetBucks Botswana, the lending company and Mintos are working on a repayment schedule to continue payment transfers to investors on Mintos in the upcoming months. At this point Mintos is evaluating the financial data of GetBucks Botswana. As you can see in the updated table above, the amount portrayed as repaid by the company is a difference of currency fluctuations among statements and does not reflect any factual repayment. GetBucks has made a payment &euro; 193 000 on 29 January which has been transferred to Mintos in February, hence not part of the reporting period in the table above and will be reported next month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>January 7 2021: GetBucks Botswana didn&#39;t make a payment in December due to an internal process of restructuring the company&#39;s cash flow to continue payment transfers to investors on Mintos in 2021. The company remains committed to the agreements to cover obligations to investors on Mintos and plans to resume the monthly repayments this month, January 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>November 27 2020: GetBucks Botswana continues to make monthly payments. Since the last update, GetBucks Botswana has repaid &euro; 300 005, including principal and interest. October 30 2020: On 30 April 2020, GetBucks Botswana and Zambia were suspended from the Primary and Secondary Markets due to failing to fulfil their payment obligations in full to Mintos investors. GetBucks Botswana continues to make monthly payments. Since the last update, GetBucks Botswana has repaid &euro; 272 091, including principal and interest.</p>",

However, since then, the situation has not moved forward, and we expect the bankruptcy process to not lead to any recoveries as Rapido does not have material assets to cover the creditors&#39; claims, according to the available information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>December 2 2021: The situation with Rapido Finance ES remains the same as in the last few updates.

We expect to receive the first payments in the coming weeks, provided the external factors don&rsquo;t change. We have reviewed all reasonable options for alternative payment routes, and they all led to the same key point: As the Russian lending companies are licensed businesses, all alternative payment routes that would allow transfers greater than RUB 10m per month include aspects that require consultation and approval with the competent regulator, the Central Bank of Russia. Mintos and the Russian lending companies are working with local consultants to obtain the Central Bank&rsquo;s approval. Revo obtained special permission from the Central Bank of Russia to repay its obligations to Mintos investors in payments larger than RUB 10m monthly. In light of this permission, Revo has already transferred the first tranche of its repayment in the amount of &euro;2.6m, and Mintos has received these funds on its accounts. In order to ensure the most fair treatment of Mintos investors in the given situation, the usual amortization sequence has been amended, and repaid funds were distributed proportionally to all affected investors based on their outstanding investments in Revo portfolios. Fees due to Mintos from Revo have also been collected proportionally, instead of collecting all fees upfront. Please note that the estimated recovery ranges don&rsquo;t account for potential sanctions against Russia or Russian retaliation measures that might be introduced due to recent developments, as the details are currently unknown.</p>",

Second, they wrote that in 2022, they started proceedings in Turkey regarding the invalidity of the arbitration clause in our agreement. An arbitration is a form of alternative dispute resolution that resolves disputes outside the judiciary courts. Back in 2022 based on this clause, we filed an arbitration claim in Latvia and informed investors about it. We have not seen the documents of the proceeding, as they have not been served to us.

                        "description": "At the time when this report was being prepared, we were checking the final details prior to submitting the claim against Wowwo to the Court of Arbitration of the Association of Latvian Commercial Banks. Mintos is working with an external team of lawyers on this case, and the claim should be submitted during the first week of June. We will share news with investors when this happens. We also want to inform you that once again we reached out to Wowwo management with the information that we\u2019re moving toward the litigation, as the last opportunity to avoid the complex legal process and find a better solution for all parties involved. We got no response.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to selection of the Court, we are also sharing the full reasoning behind this decision, which we previously shared in conversations with investors and in the Mintos Community.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe material law that\u2019s applicable to the Mintos contracts with lending companies and in the assignment agreements is the law of the Republic of Latvia (Latvian law). Latvia is the member state of the European Union, practicing laws and compliant with regulations in a way that\u2019s equal to other European member states. Latvia is also a country where Mintos products are currently built, and from where the services are provided to our customers. Since inception, Mintos has applied Latvian law to the contracts with lending companies. While there are some exceptions to this in some contracts, Latvian law is our baseline.\r\n\r\nIn terms of jurisdiction clauses in cooperation contracts with lending companies, when filing a claim, the Claimant (Mintos or a lending company), is enabled to choose to do so:\r\n- either with a regular court in Latvia,\r\n- with a particular arbitration court mentioned in the agreement,\r\n- or with the court of the country where the respondent is based.\r\nWhen it comes to recoveries, we assure you that we don\u2019t make a decision about the court selection lightly. Having such a jurisdiction clause gives us an option to choose our approach based on the evaluated pros and cons regarding a specific case within the context of each of the three options. We also engage competent local legal counsel specialized in dispute resolutions to give us insights, we analyse costs associated to the process, and based on the knowledge assessed, we arrive at the decision that is in the best interests of the investors.\r\n\r\nIn case of Wowwo, our analysis led us to a decision to opt for the arbitration court in Latvia. There are certain advantages to arbitration, the speed for resolution of disputes being the ultimate advantage. Given that in the Wowwo case, both Latvia and Turkey are parties to the New York Convention (https://www.newyorkconvention.org), when having obtained the arbitration award Mintos would proceed with recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award in Turkey.\r\n\r\nOne of the key downsides of taking the claim to the Turkish courts is the length of the process, given that the Latvian law is the material law applicable to the dispute.\u201d\r\n\r\n*Please, note the following. In the recovery report published on 5 May, we didn\u2019t portray an amount of \u20ac514 in the \u201ccolumn S\u201d named \u201cTotal recovered since the last update\u201d. Since this was no repayment per definition, we didn\u2019t add it to the last month\u2019s report. This pending amount amount emerged as we run a detailed sweep through the technical network and communication systems used with Wowwo during the preparation of the documentation for the court claim. We decided to add it back to the report anyway, in order not to disturb the reporting automation going forward, avoiding possible mistakes that might emerge in the process.",

To recap, the lending company failed to deliver on its obligations to Mintos and investors who invested in Wowwo-issued loans.\r\n\r\nAfter initial research about the institution where Mintos should file the case, we took a closer look into a designated Turkish court. We identified a number of risks and red flags related to this institution, along with costs higher than optimal. To increase the chance for a successful outcome and keep costs under control, we decided to take the case to the Court of Arbitration of the Association of Latvian Commercial Banks. We are now working on the legal documentation, and we\u2019re in the process of setting up collaboration with external law firms that would join us as supporting staff in this case.\r\n\r\nThe decision to take legal action in the Wowwo case comes after months of negotiations between the two companies, during which we advocated for the solutions that would be in the best interest of investors on Mintos. Mintos\u2019 proposals were repeatedly met with less than satisfactory response proposals from the Wowwo\u2019s management (more details in preceding reports from 3 March and 7 April).\r\n\r\nIn general, prior to choosing legal action, Mintos always looks to exhaust all other available options to finding solutions to the issue cases with lending companies. The reason for this policy is that legal proceedings come with high costs and lengthy timelines.\r\n\r\nWe will report on all new developments regarding this case in the upcoming updates.",

For example, assessing potential legal routes for recovery of the Wowwo&rsquo;s debt. In substance, Wowwo is in default on its obligations towards Mintos and international investors. Among various legal routes available, we decided on what we believe is the choice that might be the most effective in the current environment, when it comes to recovering debt from Wowwo to Mintos and investors on the platform. At the moment, we&rsquo;re finalizing the required preconditions for the process of submitting the case to the relevant authorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As explained in this <a href=\"https://www.mintos.com/blog/how-we-deal-with-loan-originator-issues-and-recovery-of-investor-funds/\">description</a>, to secure an outcome with maximum recovery potential, at this stage of the process we can only disclose limited information about the case, and we are thankful for investors&rsquo; understanding of this necessity. We also want to remind investors that the time needed to assess the best route for legal action was further influenced by the legal system in Turkey.

Mintos has sent Wowwo a notice about a material event of default, accelerating the total exposed amount of \u20ac18.5 million and stating Wowwo's obligation to repurchase all loans within a few business days after this notice. Not adhering to this request would be a breach of contract on Wowwo\u2019s part. Our credit risk committee worked to propose solution alternatives, and we shared them with Wowwo. We came to a solution for restructuring that we believe will achieve the best outcome for investors on Mintos. Our position is that investors shall receive due amounts in Euro in full, restructured to account for the company\u2019s challenging situation due to their currency exchange position.",

It was a cautionary measure to protect investor&rsquo;s interests that is driven by macroeconomic changes which impact Turkish Lira exchange rate towards Euro. A week after the suspension, our team visited Wowwo in Turkey to assess the situation on the field and evaluate the causes of Wowwo&rsquo;s interruption in payment transfers to Mintos and investors on our platform. We observed that, based on available data for the period until the recent Lira crash, the company&rsquo;s loan performance was stable, however influenced by materialized currency risks resulting in accumulated FX loss. With the possibility of further FX losses if Lira continues to plummet, Wowwo&rsquo;s management decided to freeze the transfers of borrowers&#39; payments to the investors on Mintos. As we didn&#39;t accept the initially proposed agreement from Wowwo&rsquo;s team, we will continue negotiations with Wowwo to find a solution in the best interest of investors on Mintos and our company.</p>",
