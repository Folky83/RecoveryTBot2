# Enhanced CSV Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the Perplexity news system to use `data/mintos_companies_prompt_input.csv` with rich company descriptions for dramatically improved search precision.

## Final Implementation

### Data Source
- **File**: `data/mintos_companies_prompt_input.csv`
- **Companies**: 29 companies with detailed descriptions
- **Structure**: 
  - `Company Name`: Official company name
  - `Brief Description`: Rich contextual information (geography, business type, ownership)

### Enhanced Search Terms
The system now generates highly contextual search terms:
- **Format**: `Company Name (Brief Description)`
- **Examples**:
  - `Alivio Capital (Mexican healthcare lender)`
  - `AvaFin Group (Mexican fintech owned by Capitec Bank)`
  - `ExpressCredit (Latvian payroll-deduction lender in Africa)`

### Search Algorithm
- **Prompts**: Include detailed company context for better AI understanding
- **Domain Filter**: Maintains blacklist for `nasdaqbaltic.com` and `nasdaq.com`
- **Precision**: Rich descriptions eliminate company misidentification

## Technical Changes

### Modified Files

### Key Improvements
1. **Company Context**: Each search includes business type and geographic focus

4. **Quality**: Reduced false positives through enhanced context
