										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The future of commerce in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Asia Pacific</span>&nbsp;is on display at the <a href="https://www.visa.co.uk/">Visa</a> Asia Pacific Media Showcase, where the company announced a suite of product innovations and strategic partnerships to enable a new era of commerce for the region.</p>\
<p><strong><span class="xn-person">Jack Forestell</span>, Visa&#8217;s Chief Product and Strategy Officer</strong>&nbsp;said, &#8220;Combining the strength of our global network with our leadership in payment innovation here in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Asia Pacific</span>, we are bringing new products and solutions that will transform commerce and deliver trust and security to AI-enabled payments across the region.&#8221;</p>\
<p>The Visa Asia Pacific media showcase highlighted how AI-enabled digital commerce will significantly change the way consumers across the region discover and purchase products and services. In the near future, AI agents will browse, select, purchase, and manage transactions on behalf of users, making trust in payments more important than ever. Visa&#8217;s new AI-enabled solutions offer regional partners including AI platforms, fintechs, banks, and merchants a seamless way to connect to the Visa network to deliver secure, frictionless payment experiences.</p>\
<p>Headlining today&#8217;s announcement, the company introduced<a href="https://corporate.visa.com/en/products/intelligent-commerce.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">&nbsp;Visa Intelligent Commerce</a>, a new initiative that opens Visa&#8217;s payments network to developers and engineers building the first generation of AI-powered commerce in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Asia Pacific</span>.</p>\
<p><strong>Visa Intelligent Commerce: A New Era for&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Asia Pacific</span></strong></p>\
<p>Visa Intelligent Commerce brings a suite of integrated APIs and a commercial partner program to AI platforms, enabling developers to deploy Visa&#8217;s AI commerce capabilities securely and at scale. Visa announced today that it is in explorations with Ant International, Grab and&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">Tencent</span>&nbsp;to grow AI commerce by enabling a secure and seamless checkout experience.</p>\
<p>Ant International is a leading global digital payment, digitisation, and financial technology provider. Grab is&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Southeast Asia&#8217;s</span>&nbsp;leading super app offering ride-hailing, food delivery, digital payments, and financial services across eight markets.&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">Tencent</span>&nbsp;is a multinational technology leader that develops a wide range of digital products and services, including Weixin/WeChat,&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span>&nbsp;super app.</p>\
<p>Over the past 25 years, Visa&#8217;s global network has handled 3.3 trillion transactions. Today, Visa is advancing its infrastructure, standards, and capabilities to power AI-driven commerce, opening new opportunities for consumers across&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Asia Pacific</span>. Soon, AI agents integrated into familiar platforms will be able to transact using Visa&#8217;s 4.8 billion credentials at millions of merchant locations worldwide.</p>\
<p><strong>T.R. Ramachandran, Head of Products and Solutions,&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Asia Pacific</span>, Visa,</strong>&nbsp;said, &#8220;As global commerce continues to evolve rapidly, Visa remains at the forefront of delivering innovations that will enable the future of commerce across&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Asia Pacific</span>.&#8221;</p>\
<p>&#8220;We believe AI agents will play a growing role in commerce, from handling routine purchases such as ordering food, to more complex purchases such as securing event tickets or making travel reservations,&#8221; added<strong>&nbsp;Ram</strong><strong>achandran</strong>. &#8220;By combining AI capabilities with Visa&#8217;s trusted payment infrastructure, we are enabling a seamless, secure, and more enjoyable experience for consumers, merchants, and businesses alike.&#8221;</p>\
<p><strong>New Products and Capabilities for&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Asia Pacific</span></strong></p>\
<p>Visa continues to expand its product portfolio with solutions designed to support the evolving payment needs of consumers and businesses across&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Asia Pacific</span>.</p>\
<p><strong>Stablecoins:</strong>&nbsp;Visa has been facilitating cryptocurrency transactions for over five years and is now expanding its offering to include stablecoin-backed cards, settlement, and programmable money. On and off-ramps via stablecoin-backed cards allow consumers to use their Visa credentials to buy stablecoins with fiat currency and pay with stablecoin across Visa-accepting merchant locations. In&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Asia Pacific</span>, Visa is partnering with DCS Singapore, DTC Pay and StraitsX on stablecoin-backed cards that support conversion through regulated infrastructure.</p>\
<p><strong>Enabling seven-day-a-week settlement for stablecoins:</strong>&nbsp;Visa has settled more than&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$225 million</span>&nbsp;to date in stablecoin volume that has been settled through Visa across participating clients. In&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Asia Pacific</span>, Visa is working with StraitsX for stablecoin settlement.</p>\
<p>Through the Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP), Visa provides a platform for our partners to issue and manage fiat-backed tokens, offering interconnectivity to public and private blockchains, enabling programmable financing, trading of tokenized assets and facilitating cross-border money movement. Visa is looking to expand the availability of VTAP to more partners later this year and into 2026.</p>\
<p><strong>Flex Credential:</strong>&nbsp;Visa&#8217;s Flex Credential, a next-generation card that allows users to toggle between debit, credit, and reward points, continues to gain traction in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Asia Pacific</span>. Visa first launched Flex in partnership with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) and Sumitomo Mitsui Card Company (SMCC), known as Olive, two years ago in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Japan</span>. Today, more than 5 million Olive account holders are benefitting from the Visa Flex Credential. The Olive card continues to outperform, with cardholder transactions averaging 40% higher than the national average in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Japan</span>&nbsp;over the past year.</p>\
<p>Visa and SMCC have expanded the Visa Flex Credential to support small businesses with the flexibility to switch between business and personal accounts using the same Olive card, enhancing access to credit and cash flow management.&nbsp;<span id="spanHghlta6ca">Visa is also collaborating with local banks to launch Flex Credential in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Vietnam</span>&nbsp;in the next few months.</span></p>\
<p><strong>New Strategic Partnerships to Enable More Ways to Pay and Get Paid</strong></p>\
<p>Visa is launching new services and partnerships to make it easier for consumers, merchants, and businesses in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Asia Pacific</span>&nbsp;to pay and get paid.</p>\
<p><strong>Visa Pay:</strong>&nbsp;A service designed to connect any participating wallet to any Visa-accepting merchant, local or international, in-store or online, launches across&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Asia Pacific</span>, home to the largest number of digital wallet users. Through partnerships with leading players including LINE Pay in&nbsp;<span id="spanHghlt035a"><span class="xn-location">Taiwan</span></span>, Maya in the Philippines,&nbsp;OpenRice in&nbsp;<span id="spanHghlt818c"><span class="xn-location">Hong Kong</span></span>, and&nbsp;Woori Card in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">South Korea</span>, Visa is expanding access to its global network, giving consumers more ways to pay globally by tapping, scanning or online.</p>\
<p><strong>Digital Identity:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>This suite of solutions includes Passkeys, Tap to Confirm, and enhanced data which are meant to identify and authenticate digital users. These solutions will reduce friction for consumers by being digitally native while improving payment security and authorisation rates with enhanced transaction data and state-of-the-art fraud prevention techniques. New partners in the region include Coles, a supermarket chain in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Australia</span>&nbsp;and Maybank, a leading financial services provider in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Malaysia</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Southeast Asia</span>.</p>\
<p><span id="spanHghlt94ea"><strong>Visa Accept</strong>&nbsp;is a new solution that allows micro-sellers to receive payments directly to their eligible Visa debit card using any NFC-enabled smartphone. Launching in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Vietnam</span>, the service supports micro-entrepreneurs and informal sellers such as street vendors, freelancers, and rural service providers. Participating issuers will enable cardholders to accept contactless payments through their bank&#8217;s mobile app.</span></p>\

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The financial world is undergoing a revolutionary transformation, and <a href="https://www.nyala.de/en">NYALA Digital Asset AG</a> is positioning itself as a pioneer in this change. This German company is shaping the future of capital markets and opening new paths for businesses and investors alike.</p>\
<p>NYALA is the first truly digital alternative to traditional investment banks. The company offers a platform through which stocks and bonds can be issued&mdash;without exchanges, banks, or paperwork. Faster, cheaper, and across borders. In doing so, NYALA is democratizing both capital access for companies and investment opportunities for retail investors.</p>\
<p>NYALA&#8217;s pioneering work is regulated under&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Germany&#8217;s</span>&nbsp;Electronic Securities Act (eWpG) and was recently awarded a government research grant from the German Federal Ministry of Research.</p>\
<p>NYALA solves a serious issue: traditional capital markets aren&#8217;t built for small and mid-sized enterprises. IPOs require multi-million budgets and specialized legal advisors. As a result, 90% of mid-sized growth companies lack access. This often leads to the most exciting investment opportunities being allocated behind closed doors&mdash;to exclusive investor circles.</p>\
<p><strong>A New Era for Capital Markets: DPO Instead of IPO</strong></p>\
<p>What used to be a costly and complex IPO is now a lean, digital process. NYALA enables so-called DPOs&mdash;Digital Public Offerings. Companies issue securities directly to investors via digital channels: through their websites, apps, or partner platforms.</p>\
<p>According to&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Larry Fink</span>, CEO of BlackRock&mdash;the world&#8217;s largest asset manager&mdash;the future of capital markets lies in this kind of digital securities. The market holds enormous potential: by 2030, volumes of over &euro;10 trillion are expected. In&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Europe</span>, there is an annual funding gap of &euro;800 billion that NYALA aims to close. Already, over 5,000 investors and issuers from six EU countries trust the platform.</p>\
<p><strong>An Exciting Announcement for Investors:</strong></p>\
<p>With a current share price of around &euro;90, significant short-term potential and a target above &euro;1.000, investors can now participate online&mdash;a process as simple as online shopping. And 15% of investments in&nbsp;NYALA can be refunded by the German Office for Economic Affairs. More information at&nbsp;<a href="https://digital.nyala.de/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://digital.nyala.de</a>.</p>\
<p>Against this backdrop, the business editors of the FRANKFURTER TAGESZEITUNG see NYALA as one of the pioneers in the digital transformation of the financial sector. NYALA is now expanding across&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Europe</span>&nbsp;and offers investors the chance to get in early on a promising future. With a solid foundation and a clear growth path, this&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Berlin</span>-based company is revolutionizing how capital is raised and applied to benefit the European economy. The digitization of finance has begun&mdash;and NYALA is leading it forward.</p>\

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.starlingbank.com/">Starling</a> Group today published its financial results for the twelve months ending 31 March 2025 (FY25), showing strong growth in revenue, customer numbers and deposits. This performance positions the Group well as it prepares to launch new retail and SME banking propositions, announce more international Engine by Starling clients, and create more than a thousand jobs.</p>\
<p dir="ltr">FY25 Highlights:</p>\
<ul>\
<li dir="ltr">\
<p dir="ltr">Revenue rose to £714 million, up from £682 million the previous year, demonstrating a continued robust performance across all business lines.</p>\
</li>\
<li dir="ltr">\
<p dir="ltr">Customer deposits reached a record £12.1 billion, up from £11.0 billion the previous year, demonstrating growing confidence in the bank and its services.</p>\
</li>\
<li dir="ltr">\
<p dir="ltr">Open accounts reached a new high of 4.6 million, a 10% increase from 4.2 million in the prior year, indicating continued customer acquisition success.</p>\
</li>\
<li dir="ltr">\
<p dir="ltr">Profit before tax decreased to £223 million as the Group recognised one-off costs relating to two legacy matters. Underlying profit before tax was £281million.</p>\
</li>\
<li dir="ltr">\
<p dir="ltr">The Group’s capital surplus has grown by 40% to over £400 million.</p>\
</li>\
</ul>\
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Raman Bhatia, Group Chief Executive, said:</strong> “These results represent an important milestone, marking the Group’s fourth consecutive year of profitability and revenue growth. This performance derives from our commitment to providing customers with innovative banking solutions and exceptional service. We are particularly pleased with Starling Bank’s success in attracting new customers, as evidenced by the continued growth in our deposit base and open accounts.”</p>\
<p dir="ltr">“In the last year we demonstrated our commitment to addressing legacy matters, investing in our people and capabilities so we now move forward from a position of strength. We will leverage our robust capital position to continue to scale our growth in the UK by helping our customers become better with money. We will also make great strides in turning Engine by Starling into a global success.”</p>\
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Declan Ferguson, Group Chief Financial Officer, added</strong>: “The Group generated an underlying profit before tax of £281 million. Our revised capital requirements were communicated in April, taking our total surplus capital to more than £400 million in excess of our buffers; a 40% increase on last year. In the coming months, we’ll be deploying this capital across Starling Bank, Engine and other international ventures to fuel our growth.”</p>\
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Group company contributions</strong></p>\
<p dir="ltr">During the year, Starling Bank continued to innovate with new features, such as ‘call status indicators,’ which help customers spot bank impersonation scams, and low balance warnings when a customer’s main balance drops below a pre-set threshold. The bank also launched its Easy Saver, which offers a competitive interest rate payable on balances up to £1 million, with penalty-free access and full integration into the Starling app.</p>\
<p>&nbsp;</p>\
<p dir="ltr">Engine&#8217;s first Software-as-a-Service clients, Salt Bank in Romania and AMP Bank in Australia, launched their digital banking platforms during the year, contributing £8.7m (2024: £2.3m) to the Group’s fee income. Engine is building a strong pipeline that could see it achieve recurring revenues in excess of £100 million in the short to medium term.</p>\
<p dir="ltr">Fleet, the Group’s buy-to-let mortgage company, continues to be a successful acquisition. Fleet’s lending grew by 33%, or £0.8 billion, reaching £3 billion. Mortgages grew to represent 90% of total gross lending, reflecting the Group&#8217;s focus on a secured lending growth strategy. We continue our mission to be the lender of choice in the specialist buy-to-let market.</p>\
<p dir="ltr">Overall, net fees and commissions, including fees from Engine, grew by 12% year-on-year to £94.8 million, underscoring the Group’s strategy of diversifying its sources of revenue and reducing its dependency on net interest income.</p>\
<p dir="ltr">Regulatory update</p>\
<p dir="ltr">As reported in October, the bank settled a £29.0 million fine from the FCA relating to the onboarding of certain high-risk customers in contravention of agreed restrictions and sanctions screening processes. Through extensive investment in resources and expertise relating to financial crime, Starling Bank has an established risk management and control framework that will support a new phase of safe, sustainable growth.</p>\
<p dir="ltr">The bank also recognised a £28.2 million provision related to the voluntary removal of the government guarantee on a limited number of loans issued under the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS), which the bank determined may not comply with the guarantee requirement. This proactive step further evidences Starling&#8217;s commitment to addressing legacy matters.</p>\

At the same time, Vontive launched a $150 million securitization, VNTV 2025-RTL1.</p>\
<p>VNTV 2025-RTL1 establishes Vontive&#8217;s securitization shelf, marrying a traditional structure for credit investing with its technology for digitally originating, underwriting, and servicing business-purpose mortgages at scale. Citi served as the sole lead for the transaction.</p>\
<p>Vontive&#8217;s platform uniquely connects private credit investors with real estate entrepreneurs, removing barriers for private credit to finance the revitalization of U.S. housing stock. In doing so, it tackles an urgent real-world problem: more than 70 million homes were built before 1980, according to the Census Bureau, and many will need renovation as the country faces a chronic and worsening shortage of affordable housing. Through securitization, Vontive facilitates the flow of private capital to fund real estate modernization as investors seek higher-yielding exposure to U.S. mortgage credit.</p>\
<p>Vontive has dedicated years to creating software that incorporates what traditional lenders have always been forced to do manually. Its latest advancements apply granular knowledge of housing markets, properties, borrowers, document requirements, and more to streamline and improve operations. Vontive’s platform enables capital allocators to increasingly access complex and esoteric credit assets.</p>\
<p>&#8220;There is unprecedented demand for private credit exposure from financial institutions but delivering it consistently and at scale requires Vontive’s sophisticated technology,&#8221; <strong>said Vontive CEO and Co-founder Charles McKinney</strong>. &#8220;The combination of Citi’s equity investment and full suite of capital markets solutions will enable us to supercharge Vontive’s growth sustainably.”</p>\
<p>“Vontive is a highly strategic investment given the meaningful ways that Citi’s Spread Products desks can support them. We are excited about Vontive’s growth potential and their story – they have a strong blend of mortgage and technology expertise,”<strong> said Lee Smallwood, Global Head of Markets Innovation and Investments.</strong></p>\
<p>The investment was made through Citi&#8217;s Spread Products Investment in Technologies (SPRINT) team, the strategic venture investing arm of Citi’s Spread Products business.</p>\

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vontive.com&amp;esheet=54260435&amp;newsitemid=20250526370958&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Vontive&amp;index=1&amp;md5=f4642beb25bc7ba32eed9c5319611f49" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" shape="rect">Vontive</a>, the technology company standardizing the business-purpose mortgage, today announced several first-of-their-kind data products designed to transform how private capital flows into investment real estate. Before Vontive, the entire credit asset lifecycle—from origination and underwriting to servicing and aggregation—had to be done manually. Vontive’s platform automated these processes, and its latest features add an unprecedented level of insight, intelligence, and efficiency to facilitate investments.</p>\
<p>Separately, Vontive also announced an <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesswire.com%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F20250526325049%2Fen%2FVontive-Unveils-Its-%2524150M-Revolving-Securitization-and-Adds-Citi-as-Equity-Investor&amp;esheet=54260435&amp;newsitemid=20250526370958&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=equity+investment+from+Citi+and+its+first+%24150+million+revolving+securitization&amp;index=2&amp;md5=85a2e73c0031bfd3d13c9d048e051d3c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" shape="rect">equity investment from Citi and its first $150 million revolving securitization</a>, further highlighting Vontive’s momentum in driving private credit real estate investment at scale.</p>\
<p>&#8220;Vontive has created the intelligent data backbone necessary to fundamentally change access to private credit in real estate,”<strong> said Shreyas Vijaykumar, CTO and Co-founder of Vontive.</strong> “Our latest products are about more than automation – they unlock patterns and opportunities that were previously undetectable. Vontive’s technology stack now allows us to process mortgage data with unmatched speed and scale.”</p>\
<p>The news comes at a critical time, as financial institutions actively seek higher-yielding exposure to U.S. mortgage credit. Underscoring demand, the yield spreads on traditional bonds have reached historically tight levels while private credit is expected to grow to <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.morganstanley.com%2Fideas%2Fprivate-credit-outlook-considerations&amp;esheet=54260435&amp;newsitemid=20250526370958&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=%242.8+trillion+by+2028&amp;index=3&amp;md5=55e89568227a17ab67ebdf3d21c0cad9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" shape="rect">$2.8 trillion by 2028</a>. Innovative solutions, like Vontive, are needed to channel private credit effectively and address housing market needs amid a chronic and worsening shortage of affordable housing.</p>\
<p>&#8220;For too long, the mortgage industry has been held back by time-consuming, error-prone manual processes that prohibit the ability to scale investment,&#8221;<strong> said Charles McKinney, CEO and Co-founder of Vontive</strong>. &#8220;Our mission has been to build technology that disrupts how private credit is deployed in real estate. These innovations represent years of development work that&#8217;s now paying dividends in accuracy, speed, and risk reduction.&#8221;</p>\
<p><strong>FinTech Leadership Combined with Industry Expertise to Drive the Industry Forward</strong></p>\
<p>Vontive’s data-driven infrastructure solves the fundamental challenge of scaling access to private credit: standardizing what has historically been a highly fragmented and complex market. Leveraging deep expertise in the mortgage industry, Vontive built its underlying components to work together as a flywheel to deliver unparalleled transparency and efficiency. Its latest data products include:</p>\
<ul class="bwlistdisc">\
<li><strong>AI-Powered Document Processing: </strong>Vontive&#8217;s proprietary AI pipeline processes hundreds of pages of PDFs involved in mortgage transactions, extracting key information with 95% accuracy from various document types – including purchase contracts, insurance binders, and tax certificates – and performing mathematical reasoning on extracted data (e.g., calculating annualized tax from various payment schedules) to solve problems. The pipeline feeds into Vontive’s systems to inform all aspects of the platform, identifying and analyzing vital information for more accurate underwriting and pricing while reducing processing time exponentially.</li>\
<li><strong>Loan Catch: </strong>Operating continuously in the background on every loan, this system automatically validates data across thousands of criteria, making sure all relevant points agree at all stages of the loan. This replaces lengthy, tedious manual review processes. The system instantly alerts teams when something needs attention and ensures nothing is missed, which is particularly valuable for complex edge cases that human underwriters might encounter infrequently. Learn more about how we developed this system with our partner Materialize <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmaterialize.com%2Fcustomer-stories%2Fvontive%2F&amp;esheet=54260435&amp;newsitemid=20250526370958&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=here&amp;index=4&amp;md5=3495ef55c5352628edadfbd2a4f1ed18" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" shape="rect">here</a>.</li>\
<li><strong>Loan Match: </strong>Vontive&#8217;s pricing engine encodes pricing schedules as multidimensional surfaces and automatically selects the best points on the pricing surface based on the specific loan characteristics and eligibility requirements. Borrowers are always connected with their best loan program across providers. New pricing schedules can easily be incorporated and updated via a standardized intermediate format and API, while preserving the historical policies and the ability to price as-of a specific date.</li>\
<li><strong>Construction Draw &amp; Servicing</strong>: Vontive significantly accelerates the construction draw process with virtual inspections through FaceTime-like video calls. This eliminates delays from in-person inspections and provides continuity of experience throughout the loan lifecycle through in-house servicing for all short-term loans.</li>\
</ul>\
<p>These technological advancements stack on Vontive&#8217;s proprietary forecasting system, which analyzes market activity across 10,000 U.S. zip codes. Combined, Vontive customers get greater certainty and immediate access to credit assets that provide a high-quality yield, uncorrelated with broader equity and bond markets, and based on this data-centric approach, Vontive’s delinquency rate is among the best in the industry.</p>\
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re solving the challenge of scaling access to private credit by standardizing what has historically been a highly fragmented and complex market,&#8221; McKinney added. &#8220;In practical terms, this means real estate entrepreneurs can more quickly access the capital they need to renovate America&#8217;s aging housing stock, while institutional investors gain efficient access to high-quality yield uncorrelated with broader markets.&#8221;</p>\
<p>Named to Deloitte&#8217;s 500 list for three consecutive years, Vontive has more than doubled in size and number of accounts over the past year and is well ahead of projections for 2025.</p>\

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.westpac.com.au/">Westpac</a> has built new AI technology which will revolutionise its customer support capabilities, including improving the bank’s ability to detect if a customer is being scammed.</p>\
<p>A first of its kind in Australia, the real-time call assistant technology is being integrated within the bank’s frontline customer service and operations platforms to aid bankers with customer interactions. The AI synthesises information from customer phone conversations in real-time to highlight key indicators enabling bankers to respond more effectively.</p>\
<p>Currently being piloted in the bank’s specialist scam and fraud team, the technology is helping these operators stop more scams, more quickly for customers.</p>\
<p><strong>Westpac CEO Anthony Miller says the AI is improving support for customers in crucial moments.</strong> “Our customer service specialists are often trying to solve complex puzzles with many missing pieces. In urgent circumstances, like when a customer thinks they’ve been scammed, these calls can be very emotive with lots of information that our operators need to synthesise very quickly. This AI tool is helping fill some of those gaps and is aiding our teams in real-time so they can more effectively respond,” Miller said.</p>\
<p>“As an example, when a customer is on the phone to Westpac, the AI tool will offer prompts to our operators where it detects the customer may have fallen victim to a scam. In these instances, the tool will provide suggested questions to help our customer service representative determine if the customer is at risk. It helps ensure we can deliver consistently for our customers, enhancing the skills and capability of our team.”</p>\
<p>The AI can aid operators with live transcripts, provide alerts when key indicators are detected and offer prompts to help reach an outcome more efficiently. It can also help uncover instances where a scammer may be coaching a customer in the background.</p>\
<p>“Early results from our pilot demonstrates the potential this technology has to unlock faster and more effective and consistent outcomes for customers in important moments,” Miller added.</p>\
<p>“The response from team members involved in the pilot has been equally positive. They’re having deeper conversations and getting results with those using the technology successfully stopping more scams and reaching that outcome faster than those who aren’t. This is immensely satisfying for our team who are so committed to helping our customers in those difficult moments.</p>\
<p>“Beyond scams and fraud this tool has significant potential. While still in trial phase we’re already thinking about how the AI could be deployed elsewhere in the bank to improve and streamline how our bankers support customers.”</p>\
<p>This technology is one of the first frontline AI innovations running through the bank’s ‘AI Accelerator’, bolstering its scam detection and prevention capabilities.</p>\
<p>Over the past two years Westpac has invested over $100 million stopping scams, saving customers over $500 million from being lost to scammers. This has included:</p>\
<ul>\
<li><strong>Westpac SafeBlock</strong> – rolling out later this year, it will allow customers to immediately block their account in the Westpac app or online banking, when they suspect they are being scammed.</li>\
<li><strong>Westpac SafeCall </strong>– provides customers with calls via the app that are Westpac branded, verified by Optus and show a reason for the call.</li>\
<li><strong>Westpac SaferPay</strong> – presents customers with a series of questions in instances where a payment is considered a high risk of being a scam.</li>\
<li><strong>Westpac Verify</strong> – alerts customers when there is a potential account name mismatch when they’re adding a new payee using a BSB and account number. Verify was recently introduced for St.George, Bank of Melbourne, and BankSA customers.</li>\
<li><strong>Dynamic CVC</strong> – changes the three-digit code on the back of the digital card every 24-hours. This feature is also available for St.George, Bank of Melbourne, and BankSA customers.</li>\
<li><strong>Cryptocurrency blocks</strong> – for payments to certain digital currency exchanges.</li>\
<li><strong>Merchant blocks </strong>– for payments to businesses deemed high-risk of being a scam (e.g. offering fake or misleading products and services).</li>\
<li><strong>Call spoofing measures</strong> – added 94,000 Westpac numbers to the ‘Do Not Originate’ list preventing scammers from impersonating the bank’s phone numbers.</li>\
<li><strong>Inbound payment detection</strong> – monitoring on some payments coming into the bank to check for potential scam indicators, with funds held where a scam is detected.</li>\
<li><strong>Sophisticated detection technology</strong> – advanced behavioural tool helping combat remote access scams.</li>\
</ul>\
